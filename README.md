## Datasets
The original dataset is MegaVul, you can download it from the <a href="https://github.com/Icyrockton/MegaVul">link</a>
And the processed dataset you can download from <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GuchdeFsGUKh8tvCles9kcjIcC-loD5v?usp=drive_link">Google Drive</a>

## Requriements
You can install the required dependency packages for our environment by using the following command: pip install - r requirements.txt.

## Data preprocess


## Reproducing the experiments
1.Run confidence-basedReplayEWC.py. After running, you can retrain the model and obtain results.

2.You can find the implementation code for the RQ1-RQ5 section experiments in the corresponding folders. The results obtained from the experiment are also in the corresponding folder.

## About model
You can obtain our saved model and reproduce our results through the <a href=">model link</a>
