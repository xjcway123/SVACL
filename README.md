## Datasets
<img src="figs/framework.jpg">
The original dataset is MegaVul, you can download it from the link:https://github.com/Icyrockton/MegaVul
And the processed dataset you can download from <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GuchdeFsGUKh8tvCles9kcjIcC-loD5v?usp=drive_link">Google Drive</a>

## Requriements
You can install the required dependency packages for our environment by using the following command: pip install - r requirements.txt.

## Reproducing the experiments
1.Use the py file under data crawling and processing for data processing. Of course, you can directly use the dataset we have processed: Google Drive Link

2.Run prompt_code&desc.py. After running, you can retrain the model and obtain results.

3.You can find the implementation code for the RQ1-RQ4 section and the Discussion section experiments in the corresponding folders. The results obtained from the experiment are also in the corresponding folder.

## About model
You can obtain our saved model and reproduce our results through the <a href=">model link<\a>
